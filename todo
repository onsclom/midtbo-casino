- make all messages embeds
- finish slot machine game
- make leaderboard and me list current bets?
- add button UI to accept bets

---

idea: let players create and own slot machines!

- /create-jackpot <amount>:
```
<@user> has created a jackpot of <amount>!

Use **/play-jackpot** to pay $1 for a {(1/amount)*100}% chance at the jackpot!
```

(while a jackpot is active)
- /play-jackpot
```
<@user> missed and gives 1 marble to {sponsor}!

<@sponsor> has made {amount} so far.
```
OR
```
<@user> won the jackpot of {amount}!

Use **/create-jackpot <amount>** to create a new jackpot!
```
